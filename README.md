![Scenario 2](/imgs/Scenario2.png "Scenario 2")

Two robots (UAV and UGV) populate the environment and the mission is to collect two cubes (green and blue). Both robots have the required capabilities: the UAV is able to fly, manipulate (it has a gripper attached), and perceive its surroundings, while the UGV is able to navigate, manipulate, perceive and scan. However, as seen from the figure, the reachability area of the UGV does not allow it to manipulate the blue cube, hence performs tasks involving green cube only.
